# GigFinder

GigFinder was built as a way to connect employers with temporary workers, and to connect job-seekers with casual work.  

GigFinder was created a a collaboration between Graeme Chalmers, Kieran Sharley, and Eddy Bussiere.


## Running the projects

You need **TWO** terminal windows/tabs for this (or some other plan for running two Node processes).

In one terminal, `cd` into `react-front-end`. Run `npm install` or `yarn` to install the dependencies. Then run `npm start` or `yarn start`, and go to `localhost:3000` in your browser.

In the other terminal, `cd` into `express-back-end`. Run `npm install` or `yarn` to install the dependencies, then `npm start` or `yarn start` to launch the server.

In the browser, you can click on the button and see the data get loaded.
